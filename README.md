The following is the project idea:

### Multibrain

Multibrain is a tool that can be used by any group that requires a place to brainstorm ideas together without meeting in person. Group brainstorming is often done in person, using a whiteboard or paper. Some groups may use one of the tools found online that can assist users with brainstorming. These tools typically include the mind map, importing, and exporting features, and may also contain collaboration features such as chat capability. However, most of these tools favour the mind map layout, which may not be the format all groups prefer. In addition, when there are many team members contributing during a brainstorm, it can be difficult to keep track of ideas and members are often crowded around the whiteboard or paper waiting while one person writes. Meeting in person can be a problem as group members may have conflicting schedules. Multibrain solves these issues by allowing groups to collaborate on a board online simultaneously and gives users plenty of flexibility in terms of structure and organization.
Some key features include:
- The ability to work on a board at the same time as team members
- A voice feature to allow for communication within the team
- The ability to add notes on a board, which can contain text, images, or links
- The ability to draw and add shapes directly on a board
- Being able to save a board to your profile
