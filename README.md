One of the following will be chosen as a project idea:

### Multibrain

Multibrain is a tool that can be used by any group that requires a place to brainstorm ideas together without meeting in person. Group brainstorming is often done in person, using a whiteboard or paper. Some groups may use one of the tools found online that can assist users with brainstorming. These tools typically include the mind map, importing, and exporting features, and may also contain collaboration features such as chat capability. However, most of these tools favour the mind map layout, which may not be the format all groups prefer. In addition, when there are many team members contributing during a brainstorm, it can be difficult to keep track of ideas and members are often crowded around the whiteboard or paper waiting while one person writes. Meeting in person can be a problem as group members may have conflicting schedules. Multibrain solves these issues by allowing groups to collaborate on a board online simultaneously and gives users plenty of flexibility in terms of structure and organization.
Some key features include:
- The ability to work on a board at the same time as team members
- A voice feature to allow for communication within the team
- The ability to add notes on a board, which can contain text, images, or links
- The ability to draw and add shapes directly on a board
- Being able to save a board to your profile

### Ice Breaker

SFU Ice Breaker is an online web application which helps students connect with each other in real life. Users will be assigned to a pool of students within the same class. Users can see who is in their pool, and they can send each other messages. From there, users can play draw and guess games with a random person within the pool to break the ice. The website will provide challenges that are designed to promote social-networking among students such as watching movies with new people or saying hello to 2 people every week. Accomplishing challenges earns users points, and they will be able to see the leaderboard that will display who has the most points. Finally, an event scheduler is available for students who wish to meet up in person to do activities. Canvas is a tool used by students in an academic setting, but it isn’t meant to connect students in real life. Some students use Facebook to socialize within the classroom, but many students find it difficult to ask for Facebook IDs from strangers. This project will be a fantastic tool to break the ice and make new friends in class. The target audience is students who are looking for new ways to make friends. Faculty members might be interested in this for connecting students.

Some key features include:
- Users can play draw and guess game with random person within the pool to break the ice. The game does not require both players to be logged in at the same time. 
- The website will provide with achievements and challenges that are designed to promote social-networking among students.
- Users can send each other messages.
- The website will provide with event scheduler function.


### Starving Student

Starving Student is a web-application that facilitates students in preparing meals on a budget and promotes healthy eating through interactions with other students. Students face many struggles in their day-to-day life, and one of them is meal preparation. Sometimes students don’t have enough time to prepare their meals, or don’t have enough motivation, or simply don’t have the skill to look after their eating habits. There are multiple apps out there to help with meal planning, but all of them require effort, which unmotivated, tired, hungry students might not have at the end of the day. It is much easier for students to give up and fall back onto instant meals and fast food instead of investing their time in planning their meals. Starving Student web-app aims to make meal preparation process more enjoyable for students by implementing several features like:
- A photo-feed that will allow users to post photos of their meals, along with the recipes they used
- A scoreboard with multiple categories that will display the best meals from the photo-feed based on user ratings
- Personalized alerts about sales on grocery products based on the user’s location, as well as alerts about free food on their target campus
- Suggestions for meal recipes based on the ingredients the user has at their disposal, as well as suggestions based on which recipes the user utilized before
Starving Student aims to make the cooking process more enjoyable, as well as alleviate the financial pressures that many students face on daily basis.
